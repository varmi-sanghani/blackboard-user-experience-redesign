# Blackboard User Experience Redesign

This project was developed as part of an Agile Group Assignment for a graduate-level Agile Project Management course.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to enhance the usability and functionality of the Blackboard e-learning platform. Using user-centered design and Agile methodologies, we proposed two major UX enhancements to improve the user experience for students, faculty, and teaching assistants.

## User Personas

Three personas were developed based on key user types within the Blackboard ecosystem:

- **Freshman Fiona**: A first-year student learning to navigate Blackboard
- **Professor Peter**: A senior faculty member using Blackboard to manage classes and grading
- **TA Tiwari**: A graduate teaching assistant managing dual responsibilities

## Key Deliverables

- ✅ Detailed User Personas & Day-in-the-Life Scenarios
- ✅ 15 Agile User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ UX Redesigns of Submission Page & Academic Dashboard (Built using Figma)
- ✅ Evaluation Framework for Feature Impact

## Design Tools Used

- **Figma**: For creating redesigned UI mockups of the Submission Page and Academic Progress Meter
